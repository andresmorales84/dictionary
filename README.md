Instructions <BR>
  
Choose another language besides English that you speak and write <BR>
Create a small English dictionary for this language. <BR>
For example for English to Spanish:d= {“one”:”uno”, “two”:”dos”, “I”:”Yo”, “run”:”correr”, “home”:”casa”}<BR>
Have at least 50 words in the dictionary. <BR>
The dictionary needs to be in a separate file.<BR>
Use import to import the dictionary and then use it.<BR>
Type in some English sentences (using the words in the dictionary).<BR>
Use the dictionary to translate the sentence(s) you have written.<BR>
Example, using the above dictionary:I run home -> Yo correr casa<BR>
I know it has no notion of grammar, but it is still useful to get the basic meaning.<BR>
The idea is to use: import, dictionary and string in the same program.
